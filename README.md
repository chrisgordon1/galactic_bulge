The X_CO conversion is in supplementary table 2 and can be used to convert from K km/s to column density for the first 3 annuli [out to 10kpc]. The outermost annuli conversion factor was too biased to report (see page 8 of paper).
 
The dust residual maps were fitted directly in fermitools, so there was no need for a gas-to-dust conversion. We therefore left its units in mag.
